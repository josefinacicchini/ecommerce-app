# Pawsome e-commerce app

E-commerce store created as the final project of Coderhouse's React JS course.

Allows you to browse all the products and access them by categories, go to a detailed view of each one, select the desired quantity and add these to the shopping cart. It has a preview of the cart and from there, an access to the checkout, which creates the purchase order that will be stored in the database.


This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

It uses Firebase Authentication and Database services.
